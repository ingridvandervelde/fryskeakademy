The Upload Option takes only CONLL-U file format. This format is used with text mining and natural language processing. Through downloading Corpuses from treebanks such as Universal Dependencies and converting them into the CONLL-U format, they can be uploaded onto the app to measure the syntactic differences. 
After uploading the languages, the app will ask to specify the languages of the CONLL-U files. This can be done by typing the name of the languages in the text box which will show up after uploading your files. This is important to do since those names will be represented in the table and visualisations.
