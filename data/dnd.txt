The cluster analysis is the first visualisation represented by the app. The cluster plot is represented by the dendrogram plot. A dendrogram presents the similarities of data points (understood as objects). The visualisation is in the form of cascading branches, where each branch represents a class-group variables categorised by their shared similarities. These are known as clusters, represented with different colours. 
In understanding the diagram, the height differences in the clusters and branches are representative of the differences. In short, the various clusters are indicative of the general relationship between all the various.
