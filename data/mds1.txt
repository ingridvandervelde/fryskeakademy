The Multidimensional Scaling plot is the second visualization which is represented by the app. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a type of technique found in data analysis in which the similarity and the dissimilarity is represented through individual data points and plotted on a quadrant representing the multidimensional space (Zhang, 2010). 
In short, when interpreting the graph the distance between two (or more) individual points on the multidimensional space represent closeness or dis(similarity). Thus, the closer two dimensional points are, the more similar they are and vice versa.
